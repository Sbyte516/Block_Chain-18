Private Keys and Public Keys terms are used in encryption and decryption. These keys are used to encrypt/decrypt sensitive information.

The private key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. This key is shared between the sender and receiver of the encrypted sensitive information. 
The private key is also called symmetric being common for both parties. Private key cryptography is faster than public-key cryptography mechanism.
The private key is kept secret and not public to anyone apart from the sender and receiver.

The public key isused to encrypt data.
The public key mechanism is called asymmetric being two keys for different purposes.
The public key can be used by anyone.

Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key

Start Node 2
./geth --allow-insecure-unlock --datadir node2 --unlock "Node 2 public address" â€“-mine --port 30304 --bootnodes "enode://from Node 1" --ipcdisable
The only issue is you might not need the "--ipcdisable" at the end of Node 2

Block time is the length of time it takes to create a new block or file in a cryptocurrency chain.
A block is verified by bitcoin miners, who compete against each other to solve a mathematical problem that is attached to the block.
The successful bitcoin miner is rewarded in cryptocurrency.

A block is a file that records a number of the most recent cryptocurrency transactions.
Each block contains a reference to the block that preceded it. (That's why it is theoretically impossible to alter cryptocurrency.)
Cryptocurrency "miners" race against each other to solve a mathematical puzzle embedded in the file. The winner is paid in cryptocurrency.
The solution to the puzzle triggers the currency's acceptance as a new block on the blockchain. The block has been validated. (The miner is rewarded with cryptocurrency.)
